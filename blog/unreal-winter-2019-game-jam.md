For one week out of the month of december kicks off Unreal's annual game jam in which partcipants have 5 days to complete a game from scratch along the guide lines of a theme this years theme being "Make It Count". So for this year i made a clutch or kick first person shooter sim game in wich the play must 1v5 plant a bomb and take the cat out all with in the span of 3 minutes in the process of making this game i learned valuable skills including how to create AI from scratch setting up behaviour trees, blackboards for them aswell as nav meshes,Ive improved greatly on lvl design and wet my feet with balistic systems and first person aimsets.Although i may not have placed ive learned a great deal more about game development.
