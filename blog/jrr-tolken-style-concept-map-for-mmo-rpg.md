title: JRR Tolken Style Concept Map For MMO RPG
---
I made this concept art in photo shop using a viratity of technics aswell as custom brushes this peace is concept art for a MMO RPG game i am developing using Unreal Engine ive adopted JRR's Tolken map making style into this to give it that fantasy feel the cave writings shown an the left were created using may diffrent filters to give it that stained blood feel and the grimy rock wall tecture aludes to it being a missing peace of the map and ultimatly adding more lore to the concept design
