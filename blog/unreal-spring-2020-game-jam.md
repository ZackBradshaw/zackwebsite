title: "Unreal Spring 2020 Game Jam "
---
This years game jam theme was "Whats Hidden In Snow Come Forth In the Thaw" For this jam i made a 3d sidescroller in which you play a snow/iceman who must escape spring and do so by dodging obsticals and escaping to the northpole  faling to do so will result in melting and thus losing the game with this game i decide to go for a more eye candy apporch since we all know judges love eyecandy so rather than runing from a very visiable person or object you are running from spring its self and to indicate how close spring is i did so with enviromental clues such as snow turing to moss flowers bloming and snow turing to petals i achevied this though advanced material setup on all the rocks and trees i linerly interpilated between spring and winter color by caluclating the distance it is from my spirng actor thus giving it a very natural and gradual transition
