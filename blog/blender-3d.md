It took me just about 305.6 hours to learn the exstensive 3d modeling program that is blender and i can honestly say i enjoyed every minute during this time i've learned a great deal about how to create simple and complex geometery then sculpt that geometery using varlous diffrent brushes and  softbody surfaces after wich i was then able to take that creation add rig it to the unreal skeleton and retarget various diffrent animations to it here are just a few of my earlyiest creations
